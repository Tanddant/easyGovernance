# easyGovernance â€“ governance and validation for configuration baselines in M365 made as easy as possible
*easyGovernance* offers a quick and easy way to validate several configurations and resources along predefined configuration baselines for an entire Microsoft 365 tenant or dedicated services. 
By defining a *configuration baseline* (YAML) that contains all the desired configuration parameters, this tool is a straightforward approach to govern and validate any given environment in M365. It does NOT offer a DSC setup and related mechanisms. 

Any *configuration baseline* is considered to reference the baseline suggestions from the [Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) for Microsoft 365](https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/secure-cloud-business-applications-scuba-project) by CISA and [the blueprint](https://blueprint.oobe.com.au/) by oobe.

Under the hood, the baseline validation engine is powered by the [PnP.Powershell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/) module and the [Graph PowerShell SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview). This provides us with a powerful toolset â€“ driven by the power of PowerShell ðŸ˜ƒ.

Give it a try â€“Â We're sure you will like it! ðŸ’ª

> [!NOTE]
> ðŸ‘‰ For now, configuration baselines for an M365 tenant and SPO service are currently supported  â€“ but other services will follow asap. Any contributors are welcome! ðŸ™Œ
